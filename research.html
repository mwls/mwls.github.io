							to astronomers as it absorbs the light emitted by stars. However, by absorbing the energy from the UV/optical photons, the dust
							heats up and emits light in the far-infrared. Over the history of the Universe ~50% of the light from stars
							has been absorbed and then re-emitted by dust. An example of the existence of dust that can be seen with the naked eye (from a dark
							site!) with the dark dust lanes seen towards the centre of the Milky Way.

							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>The Need for Far-Infrared/Sub-mm Data</font></b></h2>

							<p>
								While I use data at all wavelengths from UV to radio, a lot of my research is focused on using far-infrared to sub-mm data. But, why are
								measurements of dust so important? Here are just a few examples of why this data is useful:
								<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
									<li> Star-formation occurs in areas with dense gas clouds, which are normally contain a lot of dust. The UV light from the newly
										   formed massive stars could then be completely obscured by the dust. A good example of this is the plot below which shows
										   the star-formation history of the universe split by whether it's measured by UV or far-infrared emission.</li> <br>
									<li> Some galaxies contain so much gas and dust, that virtually no optical light can escape from them (some < 0.1% of energy).
										   With the large amount of gas, these galaxies can often by forming an incredible amount of stars (~1000's M<sub>&#x2299;</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>)</li><br>
									<li> While dust can be inferred from reddening and absorption, your estimates can be effected by the geometry of the dust. By measuring
										   the dust directly from its emission, you obtain an estimate of the total column-density along the line-of-sight as the emission
											 is virtually optically thin. A good example of this is the image below which shows that what you would consider a typically
											 dusty galaxy from its dust lanes, actually contains a lot less dust per stellar mass compared to some blue galaxies.</li><br>
									<li> As mentioned in the previous bullet point the far-infrared is the best tracer of the dust content in a galaxy. Far-infrared surveys with telescopes
									     like <i>Herschel</i> have detected hundreds of thousands of galaxies, far more than is possible to measure the atomic or molecular gas. However,
									     the dust can be used as a tracer of the total interstellar medium in galaxy. This is also possible to high-redshift due to the 'negative K-correction',
											 this is where for higher-redshift sources the dust peak is shifted into the sub-mm band, helping to counter-act the dimming from a larger distance.
										   </li>

							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>Resolved Dust Analysis of Galaxies</font></b></h2>

							<p>
								Resolved studies of nearby galaxies are crucial to understanding several open questions in astronomy, like how dust varies in a galaxy?,
								is there a very cold dust component to the ISM which hides a large quantity of the dust?, what is the
								relation between dust, gas and metals? or how do the conditions in the ISM effect the star-formation process?
								Nearby galaxies also give us the opportunity to understand how large-scale properties of the galaxy (like stellar-mass, the galaxies environment, etc...),
								affect the processes that occur on scales of giant-molecular clouds.

							  Studies investigating how dust changes throughout a galaxy have traditionally been very challenging due to a lack of resolution at sub-mm
								wavelengths, a wavelength range only sensitive to warm dust (< 160&#xb5;m), or lacked sensitivity. The <i>Herschel Space Observatory</i>
								revolutionised the field, with the largest mirror in space (until JWST launches!) it had remarkable sensitivity, and its two cameras (PACS and SPIRE)
								observed both sides of the SED peak (70-500&#xb5;m). I undertook the first pixel-by-pixel dust analysis using the
								first data from the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (Smith et al. 2010). I created maps of dust surface density, temperature and gas-to-dust ratio
						    for three galaxies, by fitting modified blackbodies to the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each pixel.
								<br><br>
								The figure shows the results of the SED fits, showing dust temperature, dust surface density and the gas-to-dust ratio. I found that
								the while the distribution of dust mass is symmetrical and peaks in the centre of the galaxies, while the dust temperature
								varies in the range ~19 - 22 K and peaks away from the centres of the galaxies. However, due to the angular size of the objects/resolution of
								<i>Herschel</i> we were limited by what we could learn, to get a more detailed understanding we had to switch to much closer galaxies.
							</p>

							<p>
								In December 2010 we obtained observations of Andromeda, the nearest Milky-Way like (?) galaxy, as part of
								the Herschel Exploitation of Local Galaxy Andromeda (HELGA - one of the more contrived acronyms!). We took observations in
								parallel-mode observing simultaneously at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500&#xb5;m. Our image at 250&#xb5;m which was first shown live on
								Star Gazing Live is shown below:

								This not only provided a great publicity image but allowed us to analysis the properties of dust
								in the closest Milky Way like (?) object. To analyse M31 in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/756/1/40">Smith et al. (2012)</a> we took a very conservative approach by
								smoothing and re-gridding all the images to match the 500&#181;m images; this still left us with ~4000
								quasi-independent pixels! The results of the SED fitting can be seen in the figure below.

								When fitting the SEDs I found the surprising result that a single dust emissivity index (&#946;)
								does not fit the data, instead this had to be left as a free parameter. This was the first extragalactic evidence
								from dust-emission that the properties of the dust varies within a galaxy. The radial variation of &#946;
								that I found could possibly be explained by variations in dust grain sizes, mantle growth, or composition of the dust.
								Unfortunately we were unable to identify which of these processes is causing the variations we see.
								<br><br>
								I also found that the old-stars in bulge can heat the dust to a lot higher temperatures (~30K) than is seen typically in the disk (~17K), just due to stronger interstellar radiation
								field from the density of stars. I also attempted to detect 'dark gas', that is molecular gas not traced by the usual CO tracer. Our search did not reveal a detection,
								but we were able to measure the CO to H<sub>2</sub> conversion factor (X-factor) as 1.9 &#177; 0.4 cm<sup>-2</sup> [K kms<sup>-1</sup>]<sup>-1</sup>. To see the complete results from the
								SED fitting paper click <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/756/1/40">here</a>.

								The HELGA survey has so far written seven papers based on the <i>Herschel</i> data. One science highlight by George Ford investigated the Schmidt-Kennicutt law in M31 and found that
								like other nearby galaxies investigated by the HERACLES survey that the surface-density of star-formation is best correlated to the surface-density of molecular gas, rather than atomic
								or total gas. Unlike the HERACLES team though instead of finding a power-law relationship with N~1, we find a much lower value of N~0.6. The figure on the left below
								shows the resolved Schmidt-Kennicutt law. Another interesting result by S&#xE9;bastien Viaene (shown below on the right), is that individual regions of
								Andromeda lie on the same global relations as found by the HRS sample of nearby galaxies.

								To make significant progress in the future we need to get data at longer wavelengths and higher-resolution. To address this I am leading a new large program on the JCMT called
								<a href="http://www.mwlsmith.co.uk/hashtag.html">HASHTAG</a>, to map the whole
								of Andromeda at 450 and 850&#181;m with SCUBA-2. With this data and new SED-fitting techniques we will be able to map the dust with 25pc resolution. For more details about this project

								The traditional view of early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) is that they are 'red and dead',
								i.e., they have old stellar populations, and have little or no interstellar medium/star-formation. The figure
								on the left shows this 'typical view', with the large elliptical galaxy showing no sign of dust in the <i>Herschel</i>
								image, while the smaller blue spiral galaxy contains large amounts of dust.  Using the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) I
								undertook a study of Early-Type galaxies with Haley Gomez and Steve Eales. With ~60 early-types this was the largest targeted
								survey of ETGs undertaken with <i>Herschel</i> (Smith et al. 2012).

								We found that we could detect dust in 50% of early-type galaxies (ETGs) with <i>Herschel</i>, proving that many ETGs contain
								a cool interstellar medium, although at a lower levels than spirals. The 50% detection rate is significantly higher than
								H<font style="font-variant: small-caps">i</font> and CO surveys of the same objects in the ATLAS<sup>3D</sup> survey.
								We found an order of magnitude decline in the dust-to-stellar mass ratio between spirals and lenticulars and then a

								easy to see why, on the right is the SPIRE 250&#xb5;m image shown on a log scale. The inner ellipse shows 1&times;R<sub>25</sub> which visually
