							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>Day 7 - I'm Loving Angels Instead</font></b></h2></p><p>
							   Apparently, today was international hugs day, which the local psychologist was advertising. Unfortunately, we couldn't witness the two dedicated 30 minute sessions, to see if the hug sessions were utilised. However, one thing we have noticed as a group, is that generally our students are more relaxed than in the UK about greeting each other. Certainly when you first see your friends you always shake hands with them, and for example its not uncommon to see two male students with an arm around the other's shoulder. Its nothing big, but just a bit different to what we see in the UK. We also received a lesson in Kazakh etiquette that you should never wear gloves when you shake hands (this lesson occurred when we once leaving the building and Eamonn had his gloves on).
							<br><br>
								We were back to the lab to finish the pendulum experiment today, and students were getting on with measuring gravity. Eamonn woke him with his voice largely gone - not great when you are spending the whole day explaining things for students, but soldiered through the day. The students seemed to be understanding what was expected of them, and were working nicely on their lab diaries.
							<br><br>
								In Astana we're pretty much completely reliant on taxi's which you book through the Yandex app (a bit like uber, but even more extensive). Its usually pretty quick to get a car (sometimes not at rush-hour), but it is very cheap... Pretty much every journey is £2-£3 no matter really how far you are travelling across Astana. There is a variety of drivers, most don't speak English, but you don't need to know the language to interpret some of their communication with other drivers. The driver tonight had a particular shouting match with another driver, but we made it to our destination fine. Generally, the driving style in Kazakhstan is a bit I will keep nudging my way out until I've forced my way in, which sometimes leads to tensions with drivers that don't want to let you out. There's also the added bonus that all this is playing out on ice, the drivers handle it well, but there's been a couple occasions where I noticed a slight skid.
							<br><br>
								Before we left we got recommendations on where to eat from the local marketing manager, and we decided as a group (Marcus, Laura, Eamonn, Patrick, and I - Vince had meetings/work) to go to the recommended Chinese restaurant. Its sometimes a bit hard to judge the size of portions from the picture and price, and I think its safe to see we went a bit mad, and *slightly* over-ordered on food (maybe by a factor of 2). The food was good and were clearly enjoying ourselves (see below). As another first for us in Astana, we got our first 'doggy bags', so the food didn't go to waste.

								The chinese restaurant was only a 5 to 10 minute walk from our apartments so we walked back. I decided the best route was to take the shortcut across the park, but I did slightly underestimate the deepness of the snow! (I was trying to follow the tracks someone had left earlier). However, at that point we decided to have some fun, and make snow angels. As mentioned before its so cold, that this activity is not really wet, as the snow is most definitely still frozen even with the milder (-17 to -22 C) weather.

							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>Day 6 - Getting into the Swing</font></b></h2></p><p>
							   Day 6 (Tuesday) started with the first session of our first full experiment. This is a take on the classic 'pendulum' experiment; a staple of every physics undergrad. However, instead of just timing with a stop-watch, the iOLab's are swung, which gives precision timing with its 800\,Hz sampling, and it can also measure the swing with its accelerometer, force, or gyroscope sensors.
							<br><br>
								The biggest challenge was the fact that the clamp stands (or retort stands), that I requested unfortunately weren't available due to a variety of reasons, including lack of local vendors, staff time, etc... This gave the students a lesson in improvisation, adaptability, or 'bodging' (depending on your point of view). The night before we had come up with a solution to make the lab possible; we were tempted to try hanging the iOLab's by the lights, but thought that plan was a bit unwise as they might not have been attached that securely. The solution that we came up with was to lay one of the tables on another to provide the height required. I provided our solution (see below) as one of the options but gave them the option to come up with their own alternatives (as long as it was safe). The more inventive students quickly found a better solution (see post below).

								Its early days for this course, but I know there's some academics (in schools that are outside physics) that believe the compressed/intense teaching style, could be a good model that we should apply maybe in Cardiff (i.e., concentrating on one module in 5 weeks with intensive lectures/labs/exercise classes). However, my early impression is that our more traditional longer scale is better, for the following reasons:
								<ul>
									<li>The knowledge is provided very rapidly, a more traditional course gives time for consolidation, time to think and reflect on the material.</li>
									<li>The time between doing the course and its assessment could increase (if say exams were at the end of the year).</li>
									<li>It can be exhausting... I made the comment to some staff earlier today, that each year I help out for two weeks on a camping trip for 13 year old's (80 students per week). This teaching experience is way harder. I suspect the pace maybe hard for the students as well as staff.</li>
									<li> From purely a staff perspective, unlike normal courses you can adjust the lectures, write materials. In this course you need everything ready right at the beginning, as those no time to adapt later.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								For lunch we were invited to a 'staff celebration lunch', as it was the birthday of one of the local staff. Apparently, it is tradition that if its your birthday you bring in lunch for all the staff, and it was lovely that we were strongly encouraged to attend. It was a good spread of traditional Kazakh food with items like Palif, dumplings, etc..., plus cake. There was a small speech, as well as presents. One of my biggest take-homes of this trip so far, is the CU-Kazakhstan staff have a very tight community, which hopefully persists as the University grows in size. 
								<br><br>
								In the evening Marcus, Laura and Eamonn, went to watch the champions league match between Almaty and Brugge. Unfortunately, Almaty lost 4-1, but I *believe* they scored their first goal in the Champions League, which the fans were very happy about. I heard Marcus particularly enjoyed himself, with his Brazilian heritage, and locals asking if he came to Astana for the match. I believe at one point he may have uttered the phrase "I may have come from Brazil, but today I feel like I was born in Almaty" (I've probably missed some kind of context there).

								While Vince went to do some work, Patrick and I went to get a quick beer, followed by food at an Italian restaurant. The restaurant was interesting as it was trying to resemble an Italian terrace. We may have misheard but we both thought the waiter was using some Spanish phrases rather than Italian (the football people thought their server had the correct phrases earlier on in the evening). The food though was very nice, and I splashed out on a chocolate fondant dessert which was very well done.

							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>Day 5 - The First Teaching Day!</font></b></h2></p><p>
							    After months of preparation, today was the first day of our teaching in Astana. This resulted in an early start (we met in the Lobby at 7:45), as at this time of the morning we were warned it could take up to 40 minutes to reach the campus by taxi, and we can't be late. As the year group is too big to fit in one space we teach two groups, which means we are doing 2 x 3 hour sessions each day (we're slightly jealous of our Business colleges who can fit their class in one room, so can do one two hour session each day - and get a lie-in).
							<br><br>
								Today's session is an introductory session, which started with me talking for 30-40 minutes on the expectations of these lab sessions, and what we want them to do. The next section was getting them familiar with the main device we'll be using, which is the iOLab. This is a really cool bit of kit with a large range of sensors, like voltmeters, accelerometers, gyroscopes, light sensors, which records your data to your laptop. Of course this meant that we had to get the device and software working on everyone's computer. We had issues with antivirus, firewalls, and different operating systems, but somehow despite menus being in Kazakh or Russian we managed to get (I think) everyone up or running (at least in their pairs). I've even learnt how to do it on a Mac...

								Once all the devices were up and running we did some initial data collection, but moved on to the fun experiment, how many ways you can measure your heart rate with the device. The idea here is there is at least four different ways that you can measure your heart rate with your device. What I thought was the easiest method was to measure the tiny voltage produced to induce the heart beat with the devices high-gain sensor. It turns out that either I'm either very electrically conductive, or have a very strong electrical signal, or (the most likely) I'm more sweaty so the wires can pick up the signal. Luckily, I had planned for this and with a bit of hand sanitiser gel we could get a good signal from most people.

										</span>
								</div>
							</p>
							<p>
								The most reliable way turned out to be using the accelerometer to measure the tiny movement of your chest when your heart beats. The downside to this method is in the guide I had the students laying flat on the floor, but they were quite reluctant. We managed to get round this by instead lying back on the chairs. The other interesting quirk, is to do this measurement you need to place the iOLab over your heart, and the majority of students placed the device quite significantly on the left side. I'm not entirely sure why, but I guess its similar to the UK or US where people tend to hold there arm/hand a bit to the left (i.e., during US pledge of allegiance). Overall, though the session went pretty well. Here's an example of the graphs a student made using the high-gain (i.e., electrical voltage sensor), the accelerometer, and the microphone to measure heart rate.

							By the time we packed up, and discussed the next experiment, we probably didn't leave until 6:30pm. The four of us (Vince, Eamonn, Patrick, and I) went straight for dinner, at the same restaurant from our first night. The unique bit here was the servers, I guess (??) did a traditional Kazakh dance, (resembling slight Caleigh). Apparently, this happens every evening, and people are welcome to join in (so maybe in the next video one of us will be involved). Following dinner we headed back to the hotel, where the weather was a barmy -15C. That sounds a ridiculous statement, but its amazing the different even between -25 and -30C (wind may also play a part there). You don't need quite the same level of protection, and can say ignore the thermals for ~20 minute walks.

							    Today started off again quite easy (Eamonn particularly needs his sleep), so I spent the morning finishing off my slides for Monday's introductory sessions - its getting really close now! Also Vince, my module co-lead, arrived so we had a chance to catch-up over the coffee. 
							<br><br>
								In the afternoon we decided to go to the national museum to learn about the culture and history of Kazakhstan. The building is quite impressive, and its picturesque with the snow and mosque in the background.

								Inside the museum there was a variety of exhibits, I quiet liked the one on the new Kazakh satellite that was launched, and their history of cosmonauts. There was some cool metal artwork from 3-4 century BC, and exhibits on nomadic history. During the tour I also got a handshake from one of our students in the museum, who introduced himself. I did know that some of the students were visiting on Sunday as part of their history course. One big difference between here and the UK, is that students are very keen to shake your hand (or touch chest and bow); less so in a big group, but you can be stopped several times on the stairs to shake hands.

								After the museum, we went for dinner in a restaurant that did traditional Kazakh food. To get there we walked across the botanical gardens, while you can't see many plants this time of year, the path was very picturesque with the snow. The restaurant was made to resemble a traditional Kazakh meeting place, and had a musician playing an instrument like a violin. At one point they also came round with a Kazakh tandoor, where food resembling mini-pasties were cooked by placing around the edge of the oven.

						<p>
							Another difference between UK and Kazakhstan is in a most (might be all we've been to so far) each table is fitted with a call button. So when you want to order something, or ask for the bill, you call the waiter with the button. They do often periodically come round to check on you anyway, but I like the idea as it stops you being disturbed too much during your meal, or you can get attention when you really need it. 
							<br><br> 
							We ended the day by meeting up with the two Business Studies academics who had arrived the day before. The bar was nice and the beer was 2 for 1! Finished the day with some quick slide adjustments, and some remote technical support for my mum.

							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>Day 3 - Being Tourist</font></b></h2></p><p>
							   The plan for today was to have a bit of a rest after a couple of hard days and to be a tourist in Astana. Eamonn and Patrick were going to have a lie in, but I was awake early (7am) so decided to try and sort out buying some tiny (0.01&mu;F) capacitors. This was a late addition to my list (so my fault not bought yet), and is for a final 'fun' challenge. I knew the electronics shop they visited for other capacitors using goggle maps I got a taxi up to the shop. The location was a bit outside the main tourist areas we've been used to, and was interesting to see what I guess is more 'standard' apartment buildings (interestingly I'm yet to see a house, I'm not sure they exist here). The area was a collection of shops/market stools, but while I found some signs for 'Delta', I couldn't locate it, one shop had some massive capacitors but not the tiny ones I needed. Someone in a shop I think asked if they can help me, so I showed them a picture of the Kazak/Russian sign for Delta, and they took me back to their shop and showed me a pre-made card that I couldn't read (and google translate wouldn't identify the picture without internet - we were in the basement). From a picture and with internet back I discovered that it was a note saying that the shop had moved! What we've learnt in Kazakhstan is that google maps is not widely used, instead '2GIS' is the main map app. Unfortunately, we can't install it, as our Google Play region doesn't allow it, but we can access the web version. So another taxi later I got to the shop and they didn't have any (sad face). On the return though I found the Kazakhstan equivalent of amazon, and have managed to order them, and they <b>should</b> arrive on-time.
							<br><br>
								In the above you probably notice that I took a lot of taxis. We've been setup on the 'Yandex' app which is the local equivalent of Uber. Each taxi ride seems to take £2-£3 so its very cheap! So this is our main mode of transport while we're here (particularly as the University campus is a 50 min walk from our apartments). In one of the taxi's I met a very enthusiastic 23 year old driver who wanted to trial his limited English, I'm not sure he understood most of my replies, but we did discuss a range of topics from football, to marital status, etc...  
							<br><br>
							    In the afternoon we decided to go on a walk to see the main attractions around the President's Palace/gardens. It was a barmy -25C, but luckily no wind, so didn't feel too bad. Our first stop was the Baiterek Tower, which is a national monument commemorating the founding of Astana/Kazakhstan. We went up to the viewing platform at the top.

								We then walked down to the river which apparently is quite wide and shallow, so completely freezes over in the winter. We were told last week there were bannana boats pulled by snow-mobiles that kids were riding on, and other attractions. Unfortunately, we didn't see any sort of those activities (they were possibly linked to the national holiday last week), but we did see someone ice fishing, and we got to stand on the ice!

							After this we headed to get a beer and some food. We found a microbrewery that had a very cool looking grill that cooked steaks (and other meats/fish). Both were really nice, but my personal highlight was they had a table football table! I used to play probably (too much) at Uni, and Cardiff doesn't have many tables. So we had a few games, before leaving to pick a few things up from the supermarket, and then heading back to the apartments.

							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>Day 2 - A Song of Ice and Fire</font></b></h2></p><p>
							    Today was all about trying to get everything we need to get ready for the course starting on Monday. The course is an experimental based one, where students will learn based on doing practicals and performing the analysis of the data. This obviously presents some challenges, as we need to have a range of equipment ready for the students to use. We've purchased some really cool devices (iOLab's) that have a huge range of sensors on-board, and can record data on a connected computer. However, we also required several extra items, to create some really cool experiments. This has been quite a cause for concern over the last couple months, as I guess due to the challenges of starting a new university (or otherwise), purchase of the items has been left quite late (at least compared to my try to be uber-organised self). After taking stock on Thursday of what we had, yesterday at least one of the staff members went shopping for us to get the remaining items - and we now have almost everything we need! (two items will be here, before we need them next week, and one item we can't get would have been useful but we can work around it). The delay did mean that at about 4:30-5pm we had to quickly assemble 65 experimental packs, but we are now ready to go for Monday! (special thanks to Mark, a visiting IT guy that helped us!)
							<br><br>
								During the day I also was invited to attend a meeting on Psychological First Aid. I found it very reassuring that it is taken as seriously (if not more so) here as it is in the UK. What I've also taken away from the last two days is that the students here seem to be really well supported, including an on-site doctor and psychologist. The staff also seem quite connected to the students. This I think is probably  due to there only currently being ~300 students, as this year we only have foundation/preliminary year students. Hopefully though this ethos continues as the University grows when the proper undergraduate courses start next (academic) year.
							<br><br>
							    As we were packing the boxes until ~7pm, the temperature outside had dropped to <b>-32C!</b> (this is definitely a new record for me!). As we wanted to visit the supermarket, we decided to go to the big shopping centre (which has a large supermarket in the basement), but a food court at the top. The building is about a 15min walk from the campus.  Here's us at the start of our walk:
							</p>
							<p>

								</span>
								<span class="midImgCap">
										Here's us at the beginning of the walk. Patrick in-particular wanted to look brave for the picture, while I just look like I'm about to face a blizzard!
								</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								While, I had my doubts, I have to say the Coat, and Boots provided by the University seem to be doing a very good job. However, all three us are very much of the opinion that thermals are a must when its -32C outside! . We each had purchased our own thermals as the University doesn't provide them, which we'll definitely be campaigning about when we get back (for full transparency the argument is that we would be taking taxi's everywhere so don't need to walk outside, the taxi's though sometimes park a little way or move around so its not always straightforward). In the photo I look particularly out of place with my balaclava and googles, when the locals seem to have some natural resistance, but I decided I decided I didn't mind looking out of place for a warm face! This was the photo towards the end of the walk:

									  <span class="midImgCap">
										At the end of our walk, the -32C was definitely causing some glasses issues.
									</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							As you can see Patrick's glasses are a bit of a challenge, having frozen over, also some of our outer layers were starting to freeze, but I think we were mostly all warm underneath (I think Eamonn's legs were a bit cold, as he didn't want to put thermal leggings on). The shopping centre is a cool building designed by Norman Foster to represent (I think) a Yurt, and made with some cool flexible insulating material. We found food and the supermarket, and followed it by a late-night trip to a pub/bar by our hotel.

							Finally, we decided to add a new feature to the blog -- <font color=#8a4680>Muppet of the Day!</font> (I think maybe it should be muppet of 'this' day, as its likely to be a sporadic feature). Before I go on, I want to add a disclaimer that this is done with discussion/agreement with both Patrick and Eamonn who are both happy to be featured - although there maybe a condition that we all have to win it at some point in the next two weeks. So without further ado, today's muppet of the day is ... Eamonn! 
							<br><br>
							So what did he do to win this prestigious award? Well, he was up for some competition to start as Patrick slept through two alarms with the jet lag, but it started with him smashing a glass in the office. He thought he'd lost a ice cleat in the snow, but turned out he'd put two on the same foot when reattaching them. Then as we got back to the apartments, while dropping stuff off in my room he realised he was missing his key-card and wallet. After a frantic search of his bag we decided one possibility is he left them both in his room, and so we asked his reception (see future article) to get them to let him in his room. We managed that, but no wallet or card was found. After searching his bag again we found the key-card but not his wallet. After freezing his cards (luckily can easily do that now), we left for the pub, but checked with my reception, and he had dropped his wallet there in the morning. So in the end all was well!

							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>Day 1 - Arriving</font></b></h2></p><p>
							    As so many people at work have asked for me to keep them up-to-date on my teaching trip to Kazakhstan, I thought I would start a 'blog' to keep everyone updated on the experience. Not sure we'll manage every day, as its going to get very busy.
							<br>
								So after months of planning the course, we (Patrick, Eamonn, and I) have travelled out to Astana in-preparation for the live sessions starting on Monday. The flights went smoothly, right up until the point that my bag didn't appear... Fortunately, it was found a couple hours later and I have all my luggage! It was an interesting view from the plane seeing the large ice-covered plane around Astana, with no obvious settlements/roads/etc, but then a city appear (very different to the UK).

								We were met by some members of the Cardiff University - Kazakhstan team here, who have been amazing, driving us from the airport (plus a second trip later), preparing our apartments, and getting us online with the local apps. We made it in to the building to and spent most of the day meeting all the staff members and some of the students.

							I also had a chance to pop-in to Vince's session (my course co-lead) on group work and using python to plot/fit data. I couldn't help but add some tongue-in-cheek comments to one or two of the menti questions (possibly one about downside of group work being having to attend many Univeristy management meetings...). The students seem engaged, and it was good to see them.

							That's it for today, we did go out for dinner, but then it was an early night after travelling over-night to get here. Not sure how many of these posts I'll manage to create, but I'll try to keep people updated!
