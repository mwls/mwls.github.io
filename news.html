									<h2>BT Tower is Being Turned Into a Hotel</h2>
								</header>

								<p>
									Today we had the news that BT Tower in London is being sold and being made into a hotel.
									My dad spent the vast majority of his long BT career based in the tower, was in the building when the IRA bomb went off, and I think he potentially was the last engineer based in the building. I luckily had a few opportunities 
									to visit him, see the many floors of equipment, the TV switching centre below, and watch the almost total eclipse from the top. Here's a picture of my dad at his desk and an example of a 'standard' floor with racks of equipment.
								</p>

									from my suburban garden I'm pretty happy. I'm planning to start a blog to document this, keep an eye on this space.

									I have just given my first talk at a Teaching & Learning conference! I was sharing my experience about the coursework I set my first year students where they
									have to do some practical observing. This was in a 'Pecha Kucha' format (which I'd never heard of before) where you have to give 20 slides each timed
									at 20 seconds - luckily all went well. It was also my first look at Cardiff Universities brand new and largest lecture theatre. Its a bit unusual in that
									it's really steep, but the screen is an amazing LED screen so the brightness and contrast is far better than traditional projectors. There was several 
									speakers from physics who gave some great talks about the more creative assignments we set our students.

									My PhD student, Gayathri Eknath, has been awarded a Bell Burnell Scholarship to fund her for the final year of her PhD.
									The Bell Burnell Scholarship is a great scheme to try and improve diversity in physics by providing funds for PhD students.
									Gayathri is a very motivated student and brought this fund to the attention of the department, and wrote her successfull application.
									Below is a link to a nice article/press release/interview with her on the IOP website.

								<br>
								<p>Our department coffee room, officially called the 'rest frame' (yes we are a physics department...) has reopened. During the pandemic it was turned into a furniture store due to the University no longer renting 53 The Parade. Today a team of PhD students, postdocs, and a couple restored the room to its (almost) former glory. One of my favourite features of the room is its view out over the north of Cardiff looking up to the hills. Another to notice in the far corner is our PhD 'trophy' cabinet where the cork from the post-viva Champagne bottle is stored as a momento. Unfortunately, there's a bit of gap due to Covid, but hopefully we can start to fill it up now!

								<p>I've just got back from another two weeks volunteering at my old secondary school's year 8 camp. One of the great things about
								camp is that it gives a chance for students from London to experience the outoors, leave all electronic gadgets behind and for some
								be away from home for the first time. The activities vary from canoeing, building a rope bridge over the river, to camps own olympics
								(with some very bizarre events). This year is camps 40th anniversary, and we've been using the same camp site in the new forest for
								all those years (to celebrate we took the above drone picture).
