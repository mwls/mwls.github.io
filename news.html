										<p>2025 Review - June</p>
										<h2>My First Computer!</h2>
									</header>
	
									<p>
										For a long while I've wanted to build my own PC. This started as an just a vague ambition, but I then went through a phase of watching a lot of youtube videos about building PC's (especially gaming machines). I've always slightly resisted, as I've been a fan of game's consoles, mainly as I work at a desk all day, and then I don't want to sit at a desk to relax too. However, what pushed me over the edge was my back-garden telescope started producing a huge amount of data (especially with the hyperstar), and I needed a machine to store and process all the data. Of course, I went very over the top... here's a picture:
									</p>
									<span class="zoomimage center">
										<a href="images/Computer.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="My first custom built PC!">
														<figure><img src="images/Computer.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
										</a>
									</span>		
									<br>	
									<p>
										Surprisingly, it all went very well, despite the over-engineering... The scariest part was disassembling the GPU to install the water blocks for the custom water cooling. Luckily, the GPU survived, and the whole system works great with some custom overclocks, undervolting, etc... I even managed to install a optical HDMI cable to get the signal from the PC to my TV so I can still play games from the sofa. 
										<i>(Yes I know water-cooling doesn't really have any gains over air-cooling, I just wanted to see if I could as part of the building experience)</i>

										<p>2025 Review - April</p>
										<h2>Full Academic Job</h2>
									</header>
	
									<p>
										On the 1st April this year I finally obtained a full academic position! For a variety of reasons for the past few years I had two separate 50% contracts; one as a lecturer, and one as postdoctoral research associate. I found out this would happen in 2024, which came as a massive relief, but we had to wait for the postdoc money to end before the contract would be changed. While, it was a bit of a weird situation (particularly when I got promoted to Senior Lecturer), overall I'm really luckily as there are not many full academic jobs out there (even in good times). Thanks to everyone that made this possible!

										<p>2025 Review - March</p>
										<h2>First Year Observing Trip</h2>
									</header>
	
									<p>
										For March I thought I'd talk about the observing trip I run for our first year undergraduates. As part of the 'Introduction to Astrophysics' module the students have to take a picture of something in the night sky. To try and help them with this I aim to run an observing trip, where we go to Cosmeston Lakes Country Park (not super-dark but away from the worst Cardiff light-pollution) with some telescopes, and try to them some data. This year went well as we had a couple of large (8" telescopes), but also two Seestar S50's which the students could just use themselves. I think everyone had a good time, and here are a couple pics of the night.

										<p>2025 Review - February</p>
										<h2>Six Nations</h2>
									</header>
	
									<p>
										OK, I struggled to think of what to write about for February, its usually a busy month as its when I'm undertaking my lecture course. However, I thought I'd mention the six nations, probably my favourite sporting event. For anyone that doesn't know, its an annual rugby tournament between, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, and Italy. All teams play each other once, the team with the most points at the end wins; although the ideal is to win a 'grand slam' when you beat all the other teams. As an England fan (having grown up in London), I was slightly nervous going in, but the team had some good wins, and were officially 2nd. However, the top three (England, France, and Ireland) all finished with the same number of wins and losses. Fingers crossed for next year!

										<h2>First Hyperstar Image</h2>
									</header>
	
									<p>
										I've been holding off posting about astrophotography until I setup the blog, but its been so long I thought I should include something. In late 2024 I obtained aa 'hyperstar' attachment for my telescope (that I use in my backgarden). I'll post a more detailed blog about hyperstar in the future, but broadly it converts the system from a f/10 to a f/2 system, massively increasing the field-of-view. In January 2025 I released my first deep image with the hyperstar - The Heart Nebula (click on it for a better view).

									</span>
									<br>
									<p>
										The image was taken with some ultra-narrowband filters with Halpha in red (10 hours), OIII in blue (10 hours), and SII in yellow/orange (11 hours), plus some RGB for the stars (40 min). With this image I love zooming in and seeing all the intricate details, like the dust clouds, and the random planetary nebula.

										<h2>Merry Christmas! - Year Review</h2>
									</header>
	
									<p>
										Merry Christmas everyone! At the end of the year, I've realised I've been woeful at updating my website with news, activities, and developments. So in the next 12 days, my plan is to do the year in review, and make a post about each month. Then hopefully I want to develop a proper blog which I'll try and keep regularly updated.

										To start the ball rolling, I'll share a picture from Christmas day. The photo shows the massive feast I cooked for both my Mum and me. It all went very well (except possibly the yorkshire puddings), but far too much food... although we had it again for Boxing day! Also shout-out to Farmer's Pantry butchers in Penarth whose 'feast' was amazing value with some really good produce.

									<h2>BT Tower is Being Turned Into a Hotel</h2>
								</header>

								<p>
									Today we had the news that BT Tower in London is being sold and being made into a hotel.
									My dad spent the vast majority of his long BT career based in the tower, was in the building when the IRA bomb went off, and I think he potentially was the last engineer based in the building. I luckily had a few opportunities 
									to visit him, see the many floors of equipment, the TV switching centre below, and watch the almost total eclipse from the top. Here's a picture of my dad at his desk and an example of a 'standard' floor with racks of equipment.

									I have just given my first talk at a Teaching & Learning conference! I was sharing my experience about the coursework I set my first year students where they
									have to do some practical observing. This was in a 'Pecha Kucha' format (which I'd never heard of before) where you have to give 20 slides each timed
									at 20 seconds - luckily all went well. It was also my first look at Cardiff Universities brand new and largest lecture theatre. Its a bit unusual in that
									it's really steep, but the screen is an amazing LED screen so the brightness and contrast is far better than traditional projectors. There was several 
									speakers from physics who gave some great talks about the more creative assignments we set our students.

									Below is a link to a nice article/press release/interview with her on the IOP website.

								<p>Our department coffee room, officially called the 'rest frame' (yes we are a physics department...) has reopened. During the pandemic it was turned into a furniture store due to the University no longer renting 53 The Parade. Today a team of PhD students, postdocs, and a couple restored the room to its (almost) former glory. One of my favourite features of the room is its view out over the north of Cardiff looking up to the hills. Another to notice in the far corner is our PhD 'trophy' cabinet where the cork from the post-viva Champagne bottle is stored as a momento. Unfortunately, there's a bit of gap due to Covid, but hopefully we can start to fill it up now!
