              My research interests primarily focus on investigating the interstellar-medium and how that relates to the properties of
							galaxies (for example star-formation). In particular I often work with dust, which has traditionally been seen as a nuisance
							to astronomers as it absorbs the light emitted by stars. However, by absorbing the energy from the UV/optical photons, the dust
							heats up and emits light in the far-infrared. Over the history of the Universe ~50% of the light from stars
							has been absorbed and then re-emitted by dust. An example of the existance of dust that can be seen with the naked eye (from a dark
							site!) is the dark dust lates seen towards the centre of the Milky Way.

							<h2><b><font color=#8a4680>The Need for Far-Infrared/Sub-mm Data</font></b></h2>

							<p>
								While I use data at all wavelengths from UV to radio, a lot of my research is focused on using far-infrared to sub-mm data. But, why are
								measurements of dust so important? Here are just a few examples of why this data is useful:
								<ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
									<li> Star-formation occurs in areas with dense gas clouds, which are normally contain a lot of dust. The UV light from the newly
										   formed massive stars could then be completly obscured by the dust. A good example of this is the plot below which shows
										   the star-formation hisory of the universe split by whether its measured by UV or far-infrared emission.</li> <br>
									<li> Some galaxies contain so much gas and dust, that virtually no optical light can escape from them (some < 0.1% of energy).
										   With the large amount of gas, these galaxies can often by forming an incredible amount of stars (~1000's M<sub>&#x2299;</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>)</li><br>
									<li> While dust can be inferred from redenning and absorbtion, your estimates can be effected by the geometry of the dust. By measuring
										   the dust directly from its emission, you obtain a estimate of the total column-density along the line-of-sight as the emission
											 is virtually optically thin. A good example of this is the image below which shows that what you would consider a typically
											 dusty galaxy from its dust lanes, actually contains a lot less dust per stellar mass compared to some blue galaxies.</li><br>
									<li> As mentioned in the previous bullet point the far-infrared is the best tracer of the dust content in a galaxy. Far-infrared surveys with telescopes
									     like <i>Herschel</i> have detected hundreds of thousands of galaxies, far more than is possible to measure the atomic or molecular gas. However,
									     the dust can be used as a tracer of the total interstellar medium in galaxy. This is also possible to high-redshift due to the `negative K-correction',
											 this is where for higher-redshift sources the dust peak is shifted into the sub-mm band, helping to counter-act the dimming from a larger distance.
										   </li>

							</span>
							  Studies investigating how dust changes throughout a galaxy have traditionally been very challenging due to a lack of resolution at sub-mm
								wavelengths, a wavelength range only sensitive to warm dust (< 160&#xb5;m), or lacked sensitivity. The <i>Herschel Space Observatory</i>
								revolutionised the field, with the largest mirror in space (until JWST!) it had remarkable senstivity, and its two cameras (PACS and SPIRE)
								observed both sides of the SED peak (70-500&#xb5;m). I undertook the first pixel-by-pixel dust analysis using the
								first data from the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (Smith et al. 2010). I created maps of dust surface density, temperature and gas-to-dust ratio
						    for three galaxies, by fitting modified blackbodies to the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each pixel.
								<br><br>
								The figure shows the results of the SED fits, showing dust temperature, dust surface density and the gas-to-dust ratio. I found that
								the while the distibution of dust mass is symmetrical and peaks in the centre of the galaxies, while the dust temperatre
								varies in the range ~19 - 22 K and peaks away from the centres of the galaxies. However, due to the angular size of the objects we were limited
								by what we could learn, to get a more detailed understanding we had to switch to much closer galaxies.
							</p>

							<p>
								In December 2010 we obtained observations of Andromeda, the nearest Milky-Way like (?) galaxy, as part of
								the Herschel Exploitation of Local Galaxy Andromeda (HELGA - one of the more contrived acronym!). We took observations in
								parralel-mode observing simultaneously at 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500&#xb5;m. Our image at 250&#xb5;m is shown below:

									</a>
								</span>

							<p>
								<br>
								This not only provided a great publicity image but allowed us to analysis the properties of dust
								in the closest Milky Way like (?) object.
							</p>

							<p>
								To analyse M31 we smoothed the images to the 500&#181m and re-gridded the images to 36&#180;&#180;, this still left us with ~4000
								quasi-independant pixels. When fitting the SEDs we found that a single dust emissivity index (&#946;) does not fit the data. Instead we find
								&#946 exhbits radial variations, suggesting the properties of the dust are varying inside the galaxy. The gas-to-dust ratio increases
								exponentially with radius with a gradient which matches what you would predict from the metallicity. We also attempted to detect 'dark gas',
								that is molecular gas not traced by the usual CO tracer. Our search did not reveal a detection, but we did constrain the CO to H<sub>2</sub>
								conversion factor (X-factor) as 1.9 &#177 0.4 cm<sup>-2</sup> [K kms<sup>-1</sup>]<sup>-1</sup>. To see our complete set of results see the
								full paper here (link under construction).

								The traditional view of early-type galaxies (ellipticals and lenticulars) is that they are 'red and dead',
								i.e., they have old stellar populations, and have little or no interstellar medium/star-formation. The figure
								on the left shows this 'typical view', with the large elliptical galaxy showing no sign of dust in the <i>Herschel</i>
								image, while the smaller blue spiral galaxy contains large amounts of dust. Using the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) I
								undertook a study of Early-Type galaxies with Haley Gomez and Steve Eales. With ~60 early-types this was the largest targeted
								survey of ETGs undertaken with <i>Herschel</i> (Smith et al. 2012).

									</a>
								</span>
								We found that we could detect dust in 50% of early-type galaxies (ETGs) with <i>Herschel</i>, proving that many ETGs contain
								a cool interstellar medium, although at a lower levels than spirals. The 50% detection rate is significantly higher than
								H<font style="font-variant: small-caps">i</font> and CO surveys of the same objects in the ATLAS<sup>3D</sup> survey.
								We found an order of magnitude decline in the dust-to-stellar mass ratio between spirals and lenticulars and then a
								further order of magnitude decline to ellipticals (see Figure on right).

								While writing up my PhD I noticed several <i>Herschel</i> surveys had the aim to detect hidden resevoirs of cold dust (< 15K), possibly
								in the outskirts of galaxies. However, no team had published any results finding any dust in the outskirts galaxies. The reason is
								easy to see why, on the right is the SPIRE 250&#xb5;m image shown on a log scale. The inner ellipse shows 1&times;R<sub>25</sub> which visually
								appears to contain all the sub-mm emission from the galaxy.
