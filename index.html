										<p>Welcome to Matthew Smith's Personal Webpage</p>
										<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="" /></span>I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Galaxies and Observational Cosmology group at Cardiff University. My research is focused on the dust and gas (basically any stuff between stars!) and how they relate to star-formation. I primarily work in nearby galaxies but sometimes extend further out into the universe. I moved to Cardiff in 2008 to undertake my Ph.D under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/913800-eales-stephen">Steve Eales</a> and <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/913797-davies-jonathan">Jon Davies</a> back and enjoyed living in Cardiff so much I'm still here. To find out more about my research check out my <a href="research.php">Research Page</a>.</p>
										<p>In addition to my research I play an active role in the department, being a member of a few committees (including the computer and social committees) as well as teaching responsibilities. I have the pleasure of currently supervising Thomas Williams and am significantly involved in the supervision of Connor Williams. This year I'm teaching a new first-year module "Introduction to Astrophysics" which will start in January 2018.</p>
										<p>My undergraduate bachelors and masters degree was undertaken at Cambridge University in physics (natural sciences tripos). I was a member of Jesus College where I played several
of the colleges sports teams (but definitely not to a high standard) and played in the college orchestra. While, unfortunately not playing many sports now, I am still a keen rugby fan and often get to see an international match. For the last few years I have helped on my old secondary schools year 8 camp in the new forest, where I help teach outdoor skills and run activities. I also enjoy science-fiction and fantasy, as well as a variety of video games. For more info see my <a href="Other.php">other interests</a> section.</p>

										<h2>The 'Rest Frame' is Reopen</h2>

									</span>
									<br>
									<p>Our department coffee room, officially called the 'rest frame' (yes we are a physics department...) has reopened. During the pandemic it was turned into a furniture store due to the University no longer renting 53 The Parade. Today a team of PhD students, postdocs, and a couple restored the room to its (almost) former glory. One of my favourite features of the room is its view out over the north of Cardiff looking up to the hills. Another to notice in the far corner is our PhD 'trophy' cabinet where the cork from the post-viva Champagne bottle is stored as a momento. Unfortunately, there's a bit of gap due to Covid, but hopefully we can start to fill it up now!

									<p>I've just got back from another two weeks volunteering at my old secondary school's year 8 camp. One of the great things about
									camp is that it gives a chance for students from London to experience the outoors, leave all electronic gadgets behind and for some
									be away from home for the first time. The activities vary from canoeing, building a rope bridge over the river, to camps own olympics
									(with some very bizarre events). This year is camps 40th anniversary, and we've been using the same camp site in the new forest for
									all those years (to celebrate we took the above drone picture).
